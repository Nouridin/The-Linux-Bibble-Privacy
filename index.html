    <h1>Privacy Policy for The Bibble</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 3rd of Dec 2025</p>

    <p>
        The Bibble (“the App”) is an offline Linux reference application created to help users learn Linux commands, utilities, and guides. 
        We respect your privacy completely. This policy explains what data is collected and how it is used.
    </p>

    <h2>1. No Personal Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
        The Bibble does not collect, store, transmit, share, or process any personal information.  
        The app works entirely offline and does not require an internet connection for its core features.
    </p>

    <h2>2. No Accounts or Login</h2>
    <p>
        The app does not require you to create an account or sign in.  
        No usernames, passwords, or identifiers are collected.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Local Data Only</h2>
    <p>
        Any data stored within the app (such as bookmarks or preferences) remains entirely on your device.  
        This information is never uploaded or shared with anyone.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Advertising</h2>
    <p>
        The free version of The Bibble may display ads provided by third-party ad networks such as Google AdMob.  
        These networks may collect anonymous data as described in their own privacy policies.

    <h2>5. Ad-Free Version</h2>
    <p>
        Users may optionally upgrade to remove advertisements.  
        The upgrade is processed securely through the Google Play Store.  
        The app itself does not access your payment information.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Permissions</h2>
    <p>
        The Bibble does not request any sensitive permissions.  
        It may only request basic permissions required for standard Android functionality.

    <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        The app does not collect personal information from anyone, including children under 13.
    </p>
